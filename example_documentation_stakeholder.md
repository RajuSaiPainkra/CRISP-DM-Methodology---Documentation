# Formal Documentation: Business Understanding

## For Stakeholders

#### 1. Executive Summary
<ul>
    <li>Project Title: Jane Street Real-Time Market Data Forecasting</li>
    <li>Slogan: Predict financial market responders using real-world data.</li>
    <li>Objective: Develop a forecasting model for financial market responders, specifically responder_6, using anonymized real-world data.</li>
    <li>Expected Impact: Enhance trading strategies by accurately predicting market behaviors, aiding in decision-making processes.</li>
</ul>

#### 2. Business Context
<ul>
    <li>Current Challenges: Modeling financial markets presents unique challenges due to non-stationary time series, fat-tailed distributions, and sudden market behavior shifts.</li>
    <li>Opportunity: Build robust models that reflect real-world trading scenarios, addressing modern market complexities.</li>
    <li>Strategic Alignment: Supports Jane Street’s goal of innovation in trading and machine learning applications.</li>
</ul>

#### 3. Goals and Success Metrics
<ul>
    <li>Primary Goals: Predict responder_6 values accurately over time.</li>
    <li>Secondary Goals: Demonstrate model robustness against market changes and unseen scenarios.</li>
    <li>KPIs/Success Metrics: Weighted Zero Mean R-squared (WZMR²) score of responder_6 predictions.</li>
</ul>

#### 4. Scope of Work
<ul>
    <li>In-Scope:<li>
